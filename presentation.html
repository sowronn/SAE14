			To introduce myself I’m going to ask some question to me:<br>
			-Who are you?<br>
			My name is louison Fink and I am a student in IT in Colmar.<br>
			-How old are you? <br>
			I’m nineteen until March<br>
			-Where do you live?<br>
			I live next to IUT in Colmar, but I come from south Alsace in a little village named Ballersdorf.<br>
			-do you have passion?<br>
			Yes, for sure, I play lot of video games (for example: league of legends), but I play sports too (volleyball). There is one thing a love, learning lore, facts, and information about a universe, for example the Tolkien lore<br>
			-why IT?<br>
			For me IT were a choice based on future, for me IT is an obligation, we slowly see the fact that the cyber is important. We’ve seen lately how a cyber attack can be dangerous, with the attack of uber, where have been leaked lot information about consumers. We sow too how much industries are late in cyber defense and try to upgrade there defenses only when they gets attacked.
